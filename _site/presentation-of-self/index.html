					<p>The world has been driven apart by recent events, making long distance performative interactions difficult to achieve, dividing those working in multiple regions even further. How shall we reclaim cultural exchange between the US and Hong Kong during this time of isolation? We created an art technology performance exchange between New York Hall of Science (NYSCI) (The Brick Theater) and City University of Hong Kong's Studio for Narrative Spaces.
