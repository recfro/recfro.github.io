The rise of AI tools has not only transformed work environments, but has also reshaped how people interact in communities and social relationships. Generative AI (GenAI) tools now produce artworks that are indistinguishable to the untrained eye, generate symphonic music, and create videos that reimagine movie trailers or narrate dreams. This has blurred the line between human creators and AI curators, complicating the notion of authorship. As AI becomes integrated into human culture, permeating films, museums, and social media, it embeds itself also into our imaginations and social ecosystems. This increasing presence of AI raises concerns about authenticity, as distinguishing between human-made and AI-generated content becomes difficult. This is reflected in fake news or fake social media profiles that lead to misinformation and misidentity online.<br /><br />
