The proposed research should include human-computer interaction or art-technology work, and must be scholarly in nature. We encourage interdisciplinary approaches but do not accept pure art projects. Your enquiries should indicate strong motivation for the work proposed, skills that you hope to work with, the number of hours dedicated per week, and CV.
