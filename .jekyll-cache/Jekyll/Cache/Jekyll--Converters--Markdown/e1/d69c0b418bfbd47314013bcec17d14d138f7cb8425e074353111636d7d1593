I"•<p>How long shall we be separated? How else might we break through? IN/ACTive explores the relationship between audiences and performers from distance, exploring how the classical venues for dialog between a seated audience and a staged performer can be transfigured into a physically embodied expression across a digital divide.
It is an exploration of the way technology can bring presence to distanced expressive communication, transforming the classical staged performance with the help of robotics, camera technology, and internet-of-things to a nuanced, environment-centered narrative and physical expression behind the scenes in an artist's studio.
