<p>Make4Green: A Narrative Approach to Participatory Art-making for Sustainability Awareness.<br>
Encouraging sustainable practices often involves debates about policies and resource limitations, and who should share the majority burden. Psychologically speaking, they involve negative forms of reinforcement that tell people what not to do as opposed to what they can do. This in turn leads to crisis fatigue, comfort in ignorance, and lack of belief in individual action. Studies have shown that positive forms of educational methods that activate preferred actions are more efficacious than punishments. Instead of negative forms of arguments constantly asking people for restraint, we use a positive form of reinforcement by designing activities that lets youths and older adults make creative choices in a hypothetical scenario where they face a sustainability dilemma. These half-day long excursion-workshops use scenarios of rising sea-levels, energy deficits, waste accumulation, and wildlife diversity problems as starting points of design fictions that ask participants to design architectural structures, mechanical instruments, geographical boundaries, and dissemination plans to overcome challenges in the fictional settings. The outcomes consist of artifacts like sculptures and sketches that illustrate a positive way to overcoming issues surrounding sustainability that are exhibited at renowned local galleries to engage the imaginations of youths and older adults. The approach provides a blueprint for participatory art-making that contributes to enrich understanding of sustainability issues using positive strategies for engaging the creative imagination of participants. It illustrates how storytelling and artful making can promote positive action for sustainability purposes.</p>
