<p>The current space for the movement arts are divided into finegrained, specific subareas, including specialists in forms like ballet, ballroom, street dance, improv, acrobatics, etc. Each are associated with particular cultures and demographics, and their common influence is not so much the movements themselves, but rather the cultural heritage and community they share. What if we can transcend the boundaries set by cliques of higher and lower class, eastern and western culture, and styles of male and female, to build a movement practice that can improvise in any circumstance, around any social group, and taking place in any space, both physical and digital.<br><br>
Dance Fusion is an emergent interdisciplinary practice combining improvisation, modern styling, connected dance, and musicality for both beginners to awaken their hidden talents of movement and for the intermediate movement artist to reach out beyond their own narrow discipline to improvise in a space they have yet to, but is not afraid to, explore.<br><br>
RAY LC is a choreographer and movement artist who uses technology to foster our connection to each other. He helped jumpstart the Dance Fusion community at Hong Kong, and studied Cuban Rueda at Pedro Ruiz Academy at Camaguey Cuba. He has since taught at Ripley Grier Studio and International House in New York City, numerous venues in Tokyo, as well as Hong Kong Arts Centre and Goethe Institute. His movement practice is part of the Studio for Narrative Spaces at CityU.</p>
