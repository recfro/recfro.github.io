<p>The position and momentum of a particle cannot be simultaneously measured with certainty due to the very process of observation itself. An analogous idea applies in human relations. If I try to know someone's circumstance by objectively asking factual questions, I get farther apart from her subjective experience. If I try to empathically know her by becoming like her and seeing the world from her POV, I move farther away from objective evaluation of who she is. The objective and subjective knowledge of a being cannot be simultaneously experienced due to the very process of "trying to be" itself. Decertainfy narrates the expressive potential of the human body and mind in finite spaces by trading off entropy for desire, and knowing for being.</p>
