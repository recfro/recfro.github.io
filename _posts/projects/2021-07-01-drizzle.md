<p>Climate change is difficult to grasp due to the remote nature of its action compared to immediate timeframes and surroundings, so arguments and statistics about its occurrence can fall on deaf ears, especially for science skeptics and climate change deniers, who interpret such persuasive strategies of political rhetoric. True change of people's opinions and habits requires not debates and data, but rather personal stories that align the viewer's own objectives with those of climate action. To show the consequences of climate change in data form that is palatable to climate change skeptics, we adapt a narrative strategy to show the data of climate change, creating a covert visual narrative in manga form showing both the ideals espoused by climate action and the climate change data in a visual narrative framework. These comic stories are presented for particular goals of climate action , such as individual responsibility, long-term vision, and collective conservation strategies, utilizing design fiction to narratively engage antagonistic viewpoints. To encourage audience involvement the full spread of the comic is presented on the wall of the gallery to allow visitors to read and share with others, immerse each other in the data it presents, and visually engage with the personal virtues that align with climate action without utilizing overt forms of argumentation and policy discussion.<br><br>
