<p>We reflect on our circumstances, our personal histories, and our environments from individually unique perspectives, believing that we share these perspectives with those we share our spaces with. While no perspective is entirely unique, nor are the perspectives ever exactly the same. 'Unduplicated' is a series of works narrating human and nonhuman perception through unique perspectives. It uses the media of video, interactive installation, VR, CRT TV, Apps, and print media to examine the unique and disparate ways we perceive the world.<br><br>
Videotage is a leading Hong Kong-based non-profit organization specializing in the promotion, presentation, creation and preservation of new media art across all languages, shapes and forms. Founded in 1986, Videotage has evolved from an artist-run collective to an influential network, supporting creative use of media art to explore, investigate and connect with issues that are of significant social, cultural and historical value.<br><br>
Individuals with works in the exhibition: RAY LC, Xueyun Tang, Luoying Lin, Jia Wang, Larrisa Wang, Chang Liu, Paul Shepherd.<br>
