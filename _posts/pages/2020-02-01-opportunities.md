  - title: "Prospective PhD Students."
    intro: "We value ability to work independently, interdisciplinary thinking, and open, proactive communication. Most applicants to our studio have worked with us to some capacity, typically in online projects, for example in the annual <a href='https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/rgs7kxQVYghuQMFpvK2fsA'><u>HCIX program</u></a>, or in a project of their choice. Thus please communicate with us at least 5 months before graduate admissions deadlines.<br><br>

We are currently recruiting PhD students with interests in human-robotic interaction, social computing, human-AI interaction, and technology in art and performance. We have also worked with curatorial, architectural, and mechanical engineering students, and are open to interdisciplinary candidates. Students who work with us are motivated by scholarly research and publication, and we do not accept students who are doing solely pure art practice. Positions are competitive and limited to 2-3 per cycle. Previous candidates have been fully funded through either the HKPFS or university RAships.<br><br>

In order to process your <a href='https://www.scm.cityu.edu.hk/people/ray-lc'><u>email enquiries</u></a>, prepare the following in the communication: (1) show knowledge of which area of our research you are interested to work in, based on understanding of our previous publications; (2) include evidence of sustained devotion to a past idea or project, such as a portfolio and in-depth description of a previous work and your contribution; (3) include a CV with information about your current or last school and GPA (grades are not a primary determinant of successful application); (4) put the subject heading '[SNS GRAD] - Your Name In English' on the email."
